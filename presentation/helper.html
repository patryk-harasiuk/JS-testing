          <h3>Rodzaje testów</h3>
          <p class="comment">
            There are a few different types of tests, and it is essential to
            know how they differ from each other. Most applications will require
            you to write multiple kinds of tests to get the best result
            possible.

          <h3>Testy jednostkowe</h3>
          <p class="comment">
            They are small and highly focused tests that can efficiently be
            executed on your local machine because of their fast execution time.
            You are going to have hundreds, if not thousands of these tests and
            run them on a regular basis while developing. The only downside to
            these kinds of tests is that they are not executed on real devices
            and therefore have lower fidelity than the other types of tests.
            possible.

          <h3>Testy integracyjne</h3>
          <p class="comment">
            These tests are of medium size and have a much higher execution time
            then Unit tests. They aren't executed as often but are still vital
            for checking the health status of your applications. Their fidelity
            is also a lot higher because they run on real devices and verify the
            actual interaction between various components of your application.

          <h3>Testy funkcjonalne / E2E</h3>
          <p class="comment">
            Imagine you have an application with a sign-up flow comprising of
            several steps, and you want to test the entire flow, that’s where
            End-to-End tests come into play. E2E tests will also run on real
            devices just like integration tests and therefore, will again be
            quite slow in their execution. The only downside to these kinds of
            tests is that debugging them and finding out what went wrong if a
            particular test fails becomes very hard because of their vast scope.

          <h3>Koncepty</h3>

          <p class="comment">
            Before starting to write tests for your code, you first need to be
            familiar with the most crucial testing concepts and when you need to
            use them. These concepts will influence the architecture of your
            application and how you write code in general

          <h3>Matchers</h3>

          <p class="comment">
            Imagine you have a function that calculates the result of a certain
            factorial number. Testing the function can then be done using the
            expect() function and a simple matcher that checks if the result of
            the function matches the expected value.

          <h3>Mocking</h3>

          <p class="comment">
            Mocks help your tests to avoid test unreliability (flakiness) and
            improve the speed of your tests. They are also useful if the real
            objects are impractical to incorporate into tests. In short, mocking
            is creating objects or services that simulate the behavior of real
            objects (A database, for example).

          <h3>Lifecycle</h3>

          <p class="comment">
            Here is an example of lifecycle methods in the Jest testing
            framework.
